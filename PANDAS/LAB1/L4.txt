To see if you completely understood the boolean operators, have a look at the following piece of Python code:

x = 8
y = 9
not(not(x < 3) and not(y > 14 or y > 10))
What will the result be if you exectue these three commands in the IPython Shell?

NB: Notice that not has a higher priority than and and or, it is executed first.
-----------------------

True 
False (CORRECT)
Running these commands will result in an error.
